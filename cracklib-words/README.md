Lots of password lists available here:

Various other sources. Licensing of some of these lists is questionable - however I believe
that these would reasonably fall under the 'list of facts' and 'can't copyright the phone
book' copyright scenarios. If someone objects to a list being included here, it will be
removed immediately.

It was a significant amount of work to compile this collection and
having a monopoly on regulating the CD sales is my way to compensate
