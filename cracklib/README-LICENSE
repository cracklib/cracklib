CrackLib was originally licensed with a variant of the Artistic license. In the 
interests of wider acceptance and more modern licensing, it was switched with
the original author's blessing to GPL v2. 

This approval was carried out in email discussions in 2005, and has been reconfirmed 
as of 2007-10-01 with the following email from Alec Muffett.

The license for my code in the Cracklib distribution is henceforth GPL.

Happy now? :-)
